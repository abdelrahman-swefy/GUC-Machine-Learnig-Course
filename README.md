# GUC Clustering Project

The GUC Clustering Project is an educational project designed apply clustering techniques to 3 different datasets. The project focuses on the following objectives:

1- Understanding different clustering approaches: Students will learn about various clustering algorithms, including K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixtures.

2- Explore how to tune the parameters of each clustering approach to obtain optimal results.

3- Use different distance functions and observe their effects on clustering outcomes.

4- Evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms using metrics such as silhouette score.

5- The effect of normalizing the data on the clustering results.

6- Display clustering outputs in two dimensions, highlighting the clusters.
